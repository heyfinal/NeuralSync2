- "Watch this installation process"
- Type to Claude: "install https://github.com/heyfinal/NeuralSync2.git"
- Show Claude understanding and executing installation
- "No commands. No configuration. Just English."

**Memory in Action:**
- Continue conversation from earlier
- Claude: "Continuing with your React authentication system..."
- Switch to GPT: "I see you're working on JWT implementation..."
- Switch to Gemini: "Your login component needs these fixes..."

"They're all connected. One consciousness."

### Technical Hook (90-110s)
- "Sub-10ms synchronization"
- "Works with any AI tool"
