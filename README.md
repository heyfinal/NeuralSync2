[![Installation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-Natural%20Language-purple?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/heyfinal/NeuralSync2)

**The first AI memory system that installs itself using natural language.**

## 🚀 Installation (Mind-Blowing)

```bash
# Traditional way (boring)
curl -sSL https://install.neuralsync.dev | bash

# Revolutionary way (amazing)
claude "install https://github.com/heyfinal/NeuralSync2.git"
```

Your AI handles everything automatically: dependencies, setup, configuration, daemon startup.

## ⚡ What NeuralSync2 Does

- **🧠 Shared Memory**: All your AI tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini) share the same memories
- **💾 Never Forgets**: Persistent context across all sessions and tools  
- **⚡ Sub-10ms Sync**: Lightning-fast memory sharing between AI tools
- **🛡️ Bulletproof**: CRDT-based with Byzantine fault tolerance
- **🏠 Local-First**: Your data stays on your machine

## 🤯 The Magic

```bash
# Before NeuralSync2
$ claude "help with my Python project"    # Starts fresh, no memory
$ gemini "what was that project about?"   # Doesn't know what Claude discussed

# After NeuralSync2  
$ claude-ns "help with my Python project" # Remembers everything
$ gemini-ns "improve that Python code"    # Knows exactly what Claude discussed
```

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Never re-explain context
- **Research Workflows**: Build knowledge across sessions
- **Content Creation**: Maintain narrative across tools
- **Learning**: Accumulate insights over time
