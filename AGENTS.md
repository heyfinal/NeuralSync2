## Project Modification Guidelines

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: When adding to or modifying a project, we do NOT create multiple installers or uninstallers. We ONLY modify the existing installers or uninstallers to accommodate our modifications.

### üìã Modification Workflow

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Identify existing installer/uninstaller scripts
   - Analyze current architecture and extension points
   - Plan integration approach for new features

2. **Integration Planning**
   - Design modular integration into existing systems
   - Define feature flags and configuration options
   - Plan backward compatibility approach

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Modify existing installers to include new functionality
   - Add configuration toggles for optional features
   - Implement graceful degradation for missing dependencies

4. **Validation Process**
   - Test installation with various feature combinations
   - Validate uninstallation removes all new components
   - Ensure no orphaned files or duplicate functionality

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Patterns

#### Single Installer Enhancement
```python
# CORRECT: Enhance existing installer
class ProjectInstaller:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_flags = {
            'enhanced_daemon': True,
            'warehouse_integration': False,  # Optional feature
            'monitoring': True
        }
    
    async def install(self):
        # Core installation (always runs)
        await self.install_core()
        
        # Enhanced features (configurable)
        if self.feature_flags['enhanced_daemon']:
            await self.setup_enhanced_daemon()
            
        if self.feature_flags['warehouse_integration']:
            await self.setup_warehouse()
```

#### Configuration-Driven Features
```python
# CORRECT: Use configuration for feature management
def load_installation_config():
    return {
        'features': {
            'enhanced_daemon': True,
            'warehouse': False,
            'monitoring': True
        },
        'performance_mode': 'adaptive',
        'security_level': 'standard'
    }
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO)

#### Multiple Installers
```bash
# WRONG: Creating separate installers
install_base.py           # Base functionality
install_enhanced.py       # Enhanced features  
install_warehouse.py      # Warehouse features
install_monitoring.py     # Monitoring features
```

#### Duplicate Functionality
```python
# WRONG: Duplicating installation logic
def install_base_system():
    # Base installation logic
    
def install_enhanced_system():
    # Duplicates base logic + enhancements
```

#### Hardcoded Feature Selection
```python
# WRONG: No configuration options
def install():
    install_core()
    install_enhanced()      # Always installed, no options
    install_warehouse()     # Always installed, no choice
```

## Agent Coordination Rules

### ü§ù Parallel Execution Guidelines

1. **Task Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into independent, parallel workstreams
2. **Interface Definition**: Define clear interfaces between parallel components
3. **Dependency Management**: Identify and handle inter-component dependencies
4. **Result Aggregation**: Systematically combine parallel work products

### üîÑ Communication Protocols

#### Status Reporting
```markdown
## Agent Status Report
- **Agent**: [agent-name]
- **Task**: [current-task]  
- **Progress**: [percentage-complete]
- **Blockers**: [dependencies/issues]
- **Output**: [deliverable-status]
```

#### Handoff Protocol
```markdown
## Work Handoff
- **From**: [source-agent]
- **To**: [target-agent]
- **Deliverable**: [what-is-being-transferred]
- **Status**: [ready/needs-review/blocked]
- **Next Actions**: [what-target-agent-should-do]
```
